# Rust Vulkan Video Player
## Introduction
A simple video player based on Vulkan implemented by Rust

## Abilities
- Using `Vulkano` for video playback
- Using `ffmpeg` for video decode
- Achieving synchronization between video and audio streams

## Regrets
- Vulkano doesn't support the `Vulkan Video` extensions, so I have to use ffmpeg to decode the video stream...

## Probabilities
- Maybe I can refactor this program with `Ash`...

**Under Construction...**
